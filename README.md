## About Me

I started 2019 and made massive progress in 2020. I started Python although AHK is what first got me into coding. I have since learned full stack JavaScript.

### Full Stack JavaScript

I am working my way through the online App Academy Coding Bootcamp. I have created a solo and group full stack js project with deadlines and standups for each.

### Python

I fully started learning Python in March 2020. It has been my major focus and is used in the majority of my public and private projects.

### AHK

I started learning AHK for personal use around 2015.
I began learning AHK for speeding up common tasks that were often completed in a fraction of the time thanks to AHK.

## Projects

### [clickr](https://github.com/Concrete18/clickr)

Flickr clone made solo with full stack Node.js with React/Redux.

### [Good Games](https://github.com/gmiddle/group1_project_good-games)

Good Reads variation made in a team of 4 with full stack Node.js.

### [Game Save Manager](https://github.com/Concrete18/Game-Save-Manager)

Tkinter Interface for running through an SQLite Database that allows backing up and restoring game saves easily.

### [Auto Folder Cleaner](https://github.com/Concrete18/Auto-Folder-Cleaner)

This script searches a watched directory in order to move files based on their filetypes and keywords. It works by using For Loops to go through files in the watched directory. It checks for matches in a file type and keyword Dictionaries.

### [Virtual Assistant](https://github.com/Concrete18/Virtual-Assistant)

This is my virtual text-based assistant. I made it in order to bypass the need for an interface for many smaller functions.

### [Home Control Interface](https://github.com/Concrete18/Home-Control-Interface)

Control interface that allows control of my lights, smart plugs, and PC audio default settings along with many other features.

### [Weather Wallpaper Changer](https://github.com/Concrete18/Weather-Wallpaper-Changer)

This is a script that runs in the background setting wallpapers based on the time of day and weather forecast every 20 minutes. It uses Open Weather to check the sunset and sun rise times and weather. I convert the sunset and sunrise times using code to determine if it is currently sunset or sunrise, 20 minutes each, or if it is night or day.

### [Standing Reminder](https://github.com/Concrete18/Standing-Reminder)

This app allows you to set a reminder to stop using your computer after a configurable time period. It is intelligent enough to detect inactivity after the reminder has gone off allowing you to simply walk away for your chosen time. It will also reset the timer early if it detects inactivity past a configurable threshold. The timer will also reset upon detecting a time gap in runs due to the computer going to sleep and then waking up a long enough time later.

### [Timed Sleep and Shutdown](https://github.com/Concrete18/Timed-Shutdown-Sleep)

Set timer to shutdown or sleep after a specific minute timer expires.

### [Secreit Bulk Image Loop](https://github.com/kroman4/Secreit_ImageLoop)

I contributed to this repo with kroman4. It is script for allowing her to quickly run the cell stage identification code in bulk. I only wrote the code that is loops through images and exports into a .csv.

### [Credit Card Validator](https://github.com/Concrete18/Credit-Card-Validator)

Validates Entered Credit cards and tells you the provider of the card if it is Discover, Visa, MasterCard and American Express.

### [Experimentation](https://github.com/Concrete18/Experimentation)

I use this for smaller experiments that do not warrant an entire repo of their own.
